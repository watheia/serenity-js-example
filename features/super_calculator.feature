Feature: Super Calculator

  In order to learn how to use Serenity/JS with Cucumber and Protractor
  As a Curious Developer
  I'd like to see an example

  Scenario: An actor interacts with a web page

    The ["Super Calculator"](https://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/) was developed by Julie Ralph,
    the author of Protractor, to demonstrate what Protractor is capable of.

    By the way, did you notice that with **Serenity/JS** you can use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
    to better describe each `Feature` and `Scenario`?

    Given Callie decides to use the Super Calculator
     When she adds 19 and 23
     Then she should see that the result is 42
